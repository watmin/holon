"What one fool can do, another can."
(From the Prologue/epigraph – the book's most famous motivational line, emphasizing that if someone else grasps it, so can you.)

"d which merely means 'a little bit of.'"
(Chapter I – brilliant simple explanation of the differential symbol, great for lambda calc parallels to small/incremental changes.)

"Z which is merely a long S... 'the sum of.'"
(Chapter I – explains the integral sign as summation, useful for discussing accumulation or folding in functional programming.)

"Everything depends upon relative minuteness."
(Chapter II – philosophical gem on infinitesimals, echoes lambda calc's focus on abstraction over scale.)

"dy dx is the slope of the tangent."
(Later chapters, e.g., around maxima/minima – straightforward definition of the derivative, handy for rate-of-change analogies.)

"Integration is the reverse of differentiation."
(Integration chapters – clean, memorable core idea, perfect for contrasting construction vs. deconstruction in lambda terms.)

"The integral is simply the whole lot."
(Integration section – witty summary of summing the bits back to the original, great for totality or closure concepts.)

"Some calculus-tricks are quite easy."
(Prologue – sets a light tone, counters intimidation, very usable for motivational framing.)
